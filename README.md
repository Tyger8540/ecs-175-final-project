## Procedural Generation & Particle Systems
Our project combines procedural generation and particle systems to generate a chunk of a voxel-based world. 



## Hosting and running the project
The project is a simple HTML+JS website with minimal dependencies. To run it we recommend using one of the following methods. You are free to use alternative means to host the site.

### Using Python
If you have python installed on your system you can use the built-in HTTP Server that ships with it to host the project.

*Windows & Linux*
```bash
cd /path/to/the/project
python -m http.server
```

*macOS*
```bash
cd /path/to/the/project
python3 -m http.server
```

## Using VSCode Plugin
There is a convenient plugin for VSCode that lets you host the current working directory as a website. Download and install the plugin from the VSCode marketplace:
